# Low level bindigs to the [GR](http://gr-framework.org) plotting framework

Based on version [0.37.0](https://github.com/sciapp/gr/tree/v0.37.0/lib/gks), the one installed by hombrew on osx (`brew install libgr`).
Very incomplete: I don't know how to thead with the meta thingy in ctypes, and I have yet to bind the GKS library (which includes all the constants for the plot styles).
